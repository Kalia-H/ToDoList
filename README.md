# ToDoList
This repository contains a simple yet functional To-Do List application created to demonstrate my web development skills. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and manage their to-dos efficiently.  Note: This project is currently in progress. More features and improvements are being added regularly.
